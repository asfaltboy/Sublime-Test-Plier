# Contributing

We welcome any and all contributions; open issues for bugs & suggestions and pull-requests if you want to help solve these.

### Issues

When opening issues, please try to include as much information as possible:

- Sublime Text version number
- OS type and version
- Console error output
- A description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce, if possible
- Which command caused the bug
- If you're running a build, include your build configuration JSON
- If a specific test tool fails, include it's version and output

For things that I'd like to see done first see below:

### _Things on our TODO list_

- [ ] Solve bugs
- [ ] Better test command scenarios & show coverage in docs
- [ ] document all arguments the command accepts
- [x] add an example for external test - how I use it to launch test in an iTerm2 session.
